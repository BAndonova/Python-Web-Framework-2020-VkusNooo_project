# Python Web Framework 2020 VkusNooo_project
 The final project
This is my exam project for Python Web Framework - November 2020.
The project represent a web site for creation. editing and managing recipes and users.
The recipes are divided in different categories and respectively for every category there is a separate html file.
In terms of users, we have admin, not registered (authenticated users) and respectively registered users with authorization to create/ edit/delete recipes.
I have used a ready/ free bootstrap template with ready css settings. Some of the css is also changed/ adjusted to serve the purpose/ layout.
In terms of development - I would like to add comments and like options.
